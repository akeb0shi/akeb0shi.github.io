    <p>I never expected to enjoy fashion design, as I never imagined myself as a creative person. My passions as a child have always been coding and cars. Growing up, I never cared how I dressed, focusing more on comfort in clothes rather than looks. My first year in college at Oakland, California opened my eyes to the world of fashion design. I didn't have a lot of school work, so to kill time with my friends, I decided to start designing some funny T-shirts. This eventually turned into designing some hoodies and other pieces. I eventually brought these ideas to life by sending them to a manufacturer and getting some samples made. From there, I marketed these clothes on Instagram and TikTok, and when there was enough public demand, I released my first collection to the public. 
</p>

    <p>My first collection, which had 3 pieces, was released in January of 2024. Since then, I have added 4 pieces to the original collection, and made a new collection with 2 new pieces. As of 10/24/2024, I am currently producing 5 new pieces for my third collection, and in the process of designing my fourth collection, which will be my biggest collection, and will contain 7 pieces. </p>
    <p>Here is an image of me modeling a beanie and jacket I designed.</p>
